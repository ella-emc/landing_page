# Project: Landing Page
The files in this repository are made in compliance with The Odin Project's assignment concerning Flexbox.

This is the culmination of my learnings on CSS Basics and Flexbox Basics. The instructions for the project can be found at https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page. The design is not perfectly identical to the design attached in the said webpage, although I still tried my best to make it as close as possible. 

Here is the desired outcome of the landing page as provided by The Odin Project:
